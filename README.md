# Databse Project

In this project two *Coupon Sites* are implemented, where emphasis is on the design of an appropriate database. This decision followed the following procedure:
- Requirement collection and analysis
    - Conceptual design (using Entity-Relationship Modeling)
	- Functional analysis
- Logical design
	- Opting to use relational model (compare it with other models available)
	- Changing the design into the *Boyce-Codd* normal form
	- Explaining needed Triggers and Functions
	- Identifying different views
	- Further details (e.g. domains, integrities)
- Implementing the database using `postgreSQL`

There is a [**readMe.pdf**](https://github.com/AriaAdibi/DatabseProject/blob/main/Overview/readMe.pdf) file in the Overview section where the projects are completely explained. Although, the text is in Persian language, almost all of the database codes and information (such as the ER model) can be understood just by the means of provided figures, tables and fragments of codes.
